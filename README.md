# Alexandria - Windows App Style

Library Mangement System by the Society of Software Engineers. 

The Windows App version will be running on the surface in the SSE lab and will primarily be used for checking out and checking in books.  

The web app version is located [here](http://github.com/rit-sse/alexandria).

##Note
This was made in Visual Studio 2013 so you need that and Windows 8.1 if you would like to contribute.
